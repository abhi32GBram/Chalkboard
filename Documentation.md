# Setting Up Backend & Authentication 

- Convex is  a database and comprehensive cloud backend solution.
- This means it goes beyond just storing data (like a traditional database) to include server functions, backend functionality, and the interface that communicates with your application.
- With Convex, you have a backend database where you can store your application's state.
- This state refers to the current condition or status of your application at any given time.
- You can query this state using server functions, which can be written in either JavaScript or TypeScript.
- These functions allow you to retrieve, update, or delete data stored in your Convex backend database.
- Convex also includes client libraries that help synchronize state between the client (the user's device or browser) and the server.
- This ensures that all users see the same data and that changes made by one user are immediately visible to others.
- For setting up Convex with Next.js, you can refer to the quickstart guide provided in the official Convex documentation: [https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/nextjs](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/nextjs).

# Using Clerk for Authentication

- Clerk is a service that helps you set up and manage authentication in your application.
- Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is before they can access certain parts of your application.
- With Clerk, you can easily add features like sign up, log in, password reset, email verification, and more.
- This saves you from having to build these features from scratch, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your application.
- Clerk also handles security best practices for you, such as securely storing passwords and protecting against common attacks.
- By integrating Clerk into your application, you can ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive parts of your app, enhancing its security and privacy.
